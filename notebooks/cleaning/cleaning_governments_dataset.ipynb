    "### About the Data\n",
    "This dataset is provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). \"The Database of Political Institutions presents institutional and electoral results data such as measures of checks and balances, tenure and stability of the government, identification of party affiliation and ideology, and fragmentation of opposition and government parties in the legislature ... [it covers] about 180 countries [from] 1975-2020. It has become one of the most cited databases in comparative political economy and comparative political institutions, with more than 4,500 article citations on Google Scholar as of December 2020.\" [(1)](https://publications.iadb.org/en/database-political-institutions-2020-dpi2020) For the context of this analysis, it includes 8,200 rows of data, each with 77 features. Throughout this analysis, this dataset will be referred to as the \"Governments\" dataset.\n",
